# mattMcKennaPortfolio

About The Project
Personal Portfolio

Built With
HTML
CSS


Getting Started
This project is to create a personal portfolio to sample my previous work and
how to contact me. There should also be links which navigate to sections on the page and also links which navigate to the deployed github application


Usage
There isn't a lot of interaction on this page - it is mainly for displaying information. However, there are some pieces of functionality which can be used:

Nav bar - Clicking on the links will take the user to that section
Links - clicking on the links will open a new tab for github/linkedIn
Projects - clicking on Project link will open up deployed application. Once further projects have
been completed they will be added,
Display - There is a media query for the stack icons so when the screen is resized it will display them in a column.


Roadmap
The page currently satisfies the initial acceptance criteria. However, I will be making improvements over the coming months including but not limited to:

Labels on stack logo's
Project one image
